However, if it becomes large, some people may develop pain or a pulsating feeling in their abdomen (tummy) or persistent back pain. This condition doesn’t usually pose a serious threat to health, but there is a risk that a larger abnormality could rupture. A rupture can cause massive internal bleeding, which is usually fatal. Around 8 out of 10 people with a rupture either die before they reach the hospital or do not survive surgery. The most common symptom of a rupture is sudden and severe abdominal pain.

During hospitalization, oxygen therapy may be provided to assist with breathing, and intravenous fluids may be administered to help stabilize blood pressure. In addition to adrenaline, other medications such as antihistamines and corticosteroids may be used to alleviate symptoms. Blood tests might also be conducted to confirm the condition. Discharge from the hospital is typically possible once symptoms are under control and unlikely to return quickly, though severe cases may require a longer stay. Patients may be advised to continue taking antihistamines and corticosteroids for 2 to 3 days after leaving the hospital to prevent recurrence.\n",
