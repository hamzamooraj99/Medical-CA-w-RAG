However, if it becomes large, some people may develop pain or a pulsating feeling in their abdomen (tummy) or persistent back pain. This condition doesn’t usually pose a serious threat to health, but there is a risk that a larger abnormality could rupture. A rupture can cause massive internal bleeding, which is usually fatal. Around 8 out of 10 people with a rupture either die before they reach the hospital or do not survive surgery. The most common symptom of a rupture is sudden and severe abdominal pain.
